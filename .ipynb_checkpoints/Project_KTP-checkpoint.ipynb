    "In this project, we use the learnings from week-3, week-4 and week-5 to evaluate the performance among various self-ideated portfolios and compare them against the larger market (S&P TSX 60 Index) following this, we use Monte Carlo Simulation to calculate the expected portfolio returns.\n",

    "The goal is to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: Volatility, Returns, Risk, and Sharpe ratios. This quantitative analysis will have the following steps:\n",

    "* Sharpe Ratios\n",

    "The second task is to develop a planning tool that will use the fetched historical closing prices for portfolios, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years (Cumulative Portfolio Return Trajectories). We then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount."
